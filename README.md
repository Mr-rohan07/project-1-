Useful Tools 🛠️
While working on Project 1, I found the following tools extremely helpful for adjusting image dimensions and DPI settings:

📏 Image Resizer
ImResizer: This tool allows you to resize images to specific dimensions, like 3.5x4.5 cm, which is useful for creating images that fit standard sizes. You can also adjust the background size to meet specific project requirements effortlessly.

🌄 DPI Converter
Convert Town - DPI Converter: With this tool, you can modify the DPI (Dots Per Inch) of any image, making it perfect for preparing photos as wallpapers or meeting print quality standards. Simply upload your image, and adjust the DPI setting as needed.
These tools have been essential for achieving professional image quality and formatting in my projects. Highly recommended for anyone needing precise image adjustments! 🎉
